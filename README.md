# HelpBook

## Project Description

HelpBook is a full stack app where donations and volunteering can happen. The main goal of it is to provide a platform for people and organizations to request help and users to provide it. By centralizing all of those in need and making it easier and faster for the donor to find a cause that he/she wants to support.

HelpBook is a SPA (Single Page Application) which provides a platform for the help community, where donors can make a donation securely and easily and the receivers will have a profile to ask for the help they need that will be easily accessable to donors. The app is built with the latest tools and techniques for optimized user experience.
The App utilizes React built-in and custom hooks and allows users (donors)to donate and follow users in real time. The app also allow users (receivers) to seamlessly edit, add or remove wishlist items or money goals with a user friendly pattern.
Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database. The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format.
For quality assurance, the project follows best practices of TDD (Test Driven Development), where individual Components are tested in isolation as well as End-to-End testing is performed.
